This repository contains Jupyter notebooks dedicated to the research on utilizing GPT-4 Turbo for generating defeaters in Assurance Cases. The project aims to explore and demonstrate the efficacy of advanced AI models in identifying and creating defeaters, which challenge the assumptions or claims within an assurance case. This innovative approach seeks to enhance the robustness and reliability of assurance cases by leveraging AI to uncover potential weaknesses or areas for improvement.
